Rectified Flow - Exercise Implementation
=========================================

Fill in the code sections marked with ??? to implement Rectified Flow.

Rectified Flow defines a straight-line interpolation between data (x) and noise (z1):
    z_t = (1 - t) * x + t * z1

A neural network v_theta(z_t, t) is trained to predict the velocity field:
    v = z1 - x

During sampling, we solve the ODE backwards from noise to data using the Euler method:
    z_{t-dt} = z_t - dt * v_theta(z_t, t)

    Implements Rectified Flow for generative modeling.

    Key concepts:
    - Forward process: straight-line interpolation between data and noise
    - Velocity field: the neural network predicts the direction from data to noise
    - Sampling: Euler integration of the learned ODE from noise back to data
