        input_sequences = []
        for i in range(len(texts)):
            input_sequences.append(texts[i] + answers[i])

        # Step 3 — Batch tokenization
        # Tokenize `input_sequences` with `self.tokenizer.batch_encode_plus`.
        # Use left-padding and right-truncation up to `self.max_length`.
        encoded_full_sequences = self.tokenizer.batch_encode_plus(input_sequences,
            padding="max_length", padding_side="left", truncation=True,
            max_length=self.max_length, return_tensors="pt")

        input_ids = encoded_full_sequences["input_ids"]
        attention_mask = encoded_full_sequences["attention_mask"]


        # Step 4 — Create causal labels
        labels = input_ids.clone()      # clone the input_ids
        labels[:, :-1] = input_ids[:, 1:].clone() # in a causal LM, the target at position t is the token at position t+1
        labels[:, -1] = -100  # make sure, no target (label = -100) for the very last position

        # Step 5 — Per-sample label masking
        # Even though we created labels for the input_ids, we need to mask the loss calculation for tokens that belongs to pad positions, and for the examples that were truncated

        # The tokenizer has different behavior for padding and truncation:
        # 1. If the full text (answer + question) is shorter than the max length, it gets padded on the left
        # 2. If the full text is longer than the max length, it gets truncated on the right
        # Therefore, I need to handle multiple cases, this is the different scenarios:
        # If the full text is longer than the max length, we need to set the labels to -100 for the whole sample (we want to ignore the whole sample)
        # If the full text is shorter than the max length, we need to set the labels to -100 only for the question part, and create causal language modeling labels for the answer part, taking into account the padding

        # First, compute the *untruncated* `original_lengths` token length for every input sequence
        original_lengths = [len(self.tokenizer.encode(seq)) for seq in input_sequences]
        # Then iterate over each sample i of the batch and handle two cases:
        for i in range(len(batch)):
            # Get the length of the question for this sample
            question_length = len(self.tokenizer.encode(texts[i]))


            # case A: If a sequence was truncated (original is longer than max_length)
                # Set all labels to -100 to ignore this sample entirely,
            if original_lengths[i] > self.max_length :
                labels[i, :] = -100
            # Case B: (else) sequence fits within max_length (left-padded)
            # The tokenizer left-pads short sequences, so find where non-padding tokens begin (using attention_mask)
            else :
                first_token_pos = (attention_mask[i] == 1).nonzero(as_tuple=True)[0][0] # the first 1 (non-zero value) in the attention mask for a given batch sample marks the first non-padding token
                # using first_token_pos and question_length to find the position where the question ends. Also, because labels are already shifted left by 1 relative to input_ids,
                # take into account the left shift by subtracting 1)
